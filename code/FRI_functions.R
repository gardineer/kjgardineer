#This code should be at the beginning of all of your scripts.

#Save repo to your C Drive in exactly this format:
#It requires that you create a folder in your C Drive called "GitHub" - make sure the G and H are capital.
#This is what mine would look like. Yours will be the same format of last name, first initial, middle initial and all lowercase.
home.path <- "C:/GitHub/wilsonmj"
setwd(home.path)

#Within the home.path your code, data, and plots will be stored in separate folders. 
  #Do not change the names of folders cloned from the template. 
  #If a file path is broken, change the actual path on your computer to match the code.
